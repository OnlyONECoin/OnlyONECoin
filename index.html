<title>ONLY ONE</title>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I want to learn a bit about how liquidity pools and basic tokens work, and see a chart generated from transactions.</p>
<p>so i made a <a href="https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x8cd9e09057f2d335578a9c6651b3c76ba1ab152c">shitty token</a> on the harmony network.</p>
<p>It has a circulating supply of only one, because I wanted it to be as valuable as possible without having to put a lot into the liquidity pool</p>
<p>here's the contract. <a href="https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x8cd9e09057f2d335578a9c6651b3c76ba1ab152c">0x8cd9e09057f2d335578a9c6651b3c76ba1ab152c</a></p>
<p>I created the token and dropped 8 ONE in the viperswap liquidity pool.</p>
<p><a href="https://explorer.harmony.one/tx/0xfa83d54684c97f935ad966d97802044ae57df9ea6b96417f9c118287621d781b">i have locked the liquidity forever in a black hole.</a>. So don't worry, I can't rugpull you for your 30 cents.</p>
<p>I hold 0.05 of this token in <a href="https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0xcb52f7408611f808206d3bb52a06dd9e74f8cc30">my wallet.</a></p>

<p>even if you don't have harmony, you can earn about one harmony token in 10 minutes by playing this <a href="https://cryptoroyale.one/ranked/">play-to-earn game</a>

<p>this token is clearly not an investment. But if you could exchange a little harmony dust for the token, I would appreciate it a lot.</p>


<p><a href="https://info.viper.exchange/token/0x8cd9e09057f2d335578a9c6651b3c76ba1ab152c">this should generate a chart as the token is bought and sold in the pool</a></p>

<p><a href="https://viper.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x8cd9e09057f2d335578a9c6651b3c76ba1ab152c">you can buy here.</a></p>

<p>thanks <3</p>
